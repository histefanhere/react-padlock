This is my submission project for a [NZMSA Post Workshop Competition](https://github.com/NZMSA/2021-introduction-to-general-software-development). It is a padlock web app where you try and unlock a padlock that has a set 3 digit combination. With a clean design and plenty of visual flares, it was a blast to make!

**THE PASSWORD FOR THE LOCK IS 1-2-3.**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and it uses the languages and frameworks taught at the Software Development Workshop, most of which were new to me, such as:
- Typescript
- React
- create-react-app
- Git and GitHub
- HTML and CSS (and SASS as an extra challenge)
- Many other JS node librires, such as [react-anime](https://alain.xyz/libraries/react-anime) for the animations, and [github-corners](https://tholman.com/github-corners/) for the github link.

## Getting Started

Firstly, run `npm install` to install all the project dependancies.

Next, run either `npm start` or `npm run build` depending on if you want to run the app in development mode (open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser) or if you want to build the app for production (it gets deployed in the `build` folder _but make sure to change the 'homepage' option in `package.json`)._

## Credits

Massive shoutout to the time and effort put into the documentation for react, create-react-app, typescript, and animejs. Community efforts such as [this cheatsheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/setup/) proved priceless, but obviously the biggest source of help was the MSA team. The written README guides on their GitHub repository are awesome summaries of the workshop!

## Contributing

Ha, hilarious joke. But all issues are welcome! A lot of what I used is new to me, and chances are I'm not doing it right.
